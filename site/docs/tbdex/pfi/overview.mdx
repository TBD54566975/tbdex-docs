# PFI Overview

PFIs are **Participating Financial Institutions** that offer liquidity on a tbDEX network.

PFIs make themselves known to [Wallet applications](/tbdex/wallet/overview) and engage in verifying necessary information for transaction completion with <Web5Url to="/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs">Verifiable Credential</Web5Url> Issuers.

For more on how PFIs fit into the overall structure of tbDEX, please [refer to the tbDEX overview](/tbdex/#example-scenario).

The PFI guides are intended to provide you with what you need to begin participating on a tbDEX network.
