# Onboarding

Before beginning development of your PFI’s code, you’ll need to create an identity to use on the network. A tbDEX network is built to be decentralized, which is why you’ll need to create your own <Web5Url to="/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</Web5Url> to assign to the PFI. That DID will represent the PFI, as well as serve as the signer for tbDEX messages and resources that are sent to other parties.

DIDs are associated with <Web5Url to="/decentralized-identifiers/did_documents">DID Documents</Web5Url> which describe how to engage with your PFI.

To create a DID and identify yourself as a PFI, use the `web5/dids` package:

### Import Classes

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'pfiOnboardingImportsJs', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'pfiOnboardingImportsKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
  ]}
/>

### Create DID with Service Endpoint

For a DID to be recognized as a PFI, it is important to include a service endpoint in the DID document. The value for `serviceEndpoint` should be the URL to your PFI's service entry.

If you also have an existing key management system to secure your secrets e.g., [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/), [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management), etc., creating a DID provides a `keyManager` interface that you can pass it through.

<Shnip
  snippets={[
    { snippetName: 'pfiOnboardingCreateDidJs', language: 'JavaScript' },
    { snippetName: 'pfiOnboardingCreateDidKt', language: 'Kotlin' },
  ]}
/>

:::note Notes

- `LocalKeyManager` or `InMemoryKeyManager` should only be used in non-production environments. See <Web5Url to="/decentralized-identifiers/key-management">Key Management Service</Web5Url> for more details.
